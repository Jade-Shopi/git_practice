## Overview

### The purpose of this guide

The Help Center is a key component in building trust with Shopify's merchants. The more clear, concise, accurate, and useful the content is, the faster a merchant can get back to running and growing their business. For the Help Center to be as effective as possible, the content must be consistent and of high quality.

If you write or review content for the Shopify Help Center, then use this guide to help maintain consistency and quality across the Help Center.

### Using the style guide

This guide is intended as a reference. You might want to read the guide through at least once to familiarize yourself with its topics. However, in most cases you can search in the guide to find specific answers to questions you have about content structure, tone, grammar, punctuation, or formatting.

### Source of style decisions

Style guidance in this guide is based on in-house conventions and industry standards, and is periodically reviewed by the Product Docs team. When the guidance doesn't answer a question of style, we refer to [Polaris](https://polaris.shopify.com/). For spelling of terms that aren't specific to Shopify, our reference is [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/).

### Send feedback about the style guide

## General writing principles

### Plan for your audience

The Shopify Help Center should reflect its intended audience. Each type of Shopify users has specific needs and expectations when reading Help Center content:

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Prospective users</th>
    <th>Novice users</th>
    <th>Experienced users</th>
    <th>Highly technical users</th>
	</tr>
  <tr>
    <td>quick-start guides, conceptual overviews</td>
	  <td>clear step-by-step instructions, conceptual overviews, definitions of terms, tutorials, context-sensitive help</td>
    <td>clear step-by-step instructions, conceptual overviews, definitions of terms, more challenging tutorials, context-sensitive help</td>
    <td>procedural instructions (can be blunt), code fragments, links to information sources</td>
	</tr>
</table>

To accommodate a range of users and their objectives, you can organize content to include information appropriate for different levels of expertise, different learning styles, and different ways of using Shopify.

### Use the right voice and tone

#### Voice

Help Center content should match Shopify's voice in reflecting our commitment to helping our merchants to succeed. The following guidelines from the [Shopify voice and tone](https://polaris.shopify.com/content/voice-and-tone#navigation) guide can be applied to the Help Center:

  * Use business casual language—be plain-spoken, not pretentious or overly playful.
  * Communicate with clarity and empathy—be direct, not insensitive.
  * Avoid words that generalize success like “every,” “all,” and “most”.
  * Use language that supports action, movement, and progress.
  * Use expertise to help merchants succeed; don’t talk down to them.
  * Be specific when explaining benefits without making things sound better than they are.
  * Teach people the “why” and “how” behind actions—don’t just tell them to do something.

#### Tone

For the Help Center documentation, you should in general be writing in a tone that matches the following:

  * genuine, rather than trying for humor
  * relaxed and authoritative, instead of formal
  * respectful, not cheeky or flippant
  * practical and encouraging, instead of radical

The tone that you use when writing for the Help Center depends on whether you're writing more general, introductory content or more specific, technical content. For example, by using a more informal and accessible tone in introductory material, you can help a reader become more comfortable with the topic and encourage them to read more. As you move into more task-oriented or technical content, you can use more direct language, because readers using those parts of documentation are usually focused on the task or on finding out more information.

#### Voice and tone in practice

To maintain the consistency of voice and tone in the Help Center, follow these guidelines:

  * Wherever possible, avoid using the passive voice. Frame the document in terms of “what the merchant does" instead of “what is being done by the merchant.” For example, use "You can add a product on the Products page." instead of "Products can be added on the Products page". Hint: Note the verb change of "add" to "be added", this often indicates a change from active to passive voice.
  
  * Avoid personifying Shopify; avoid having Shopify be the one performing actions or having feelings, such as: "Shopify wants you to succeed!" or "Shopify adds the product to your collection.". 

  * Use contractions, such as "you’re", "isn’t", and "can't", to establish an informal and friendly tone.

  * Address the reader as “you”. Use "merchants" when referring to people using Shopify in general and "customers" when referring to those who place orders on Shopify stores. 

  * Avoid colloquialisms, jokes, sarcasm, jargon, and slang, as well as culturally specific references.

  * Use linking adverbs, conjunctions, and prepostions liberally to avoid choppy writing.

  * Vary your sentence structure to keep readers engaged, especially in longer paragraphs.

  * Don’t use emoticons because they alienate some types of reader. Sorry :(

## Write for a global audience

Making commerce better for everyone means making our products work for people all over the world. These guidelines help us design, write, and build products for the global market.

### Building for a global audience

Making our content and interface work for a global audience includes more than just translation. Our goal is to make everything we create easy to understand for the following audiences:

* native English speakers
* non-native English speakers
* translators hired to localize our content
* people reading the translated content

### Writing

Our writing should be easy to translate and easy to understand by merchants who aren’t native English speakers.

#### Keep sentences and paragraphs short

In general, shorter sentences are easier to understand and translate.

Break up long sentences into shorter ones. Sometimes you may need rewrite or rephrase your sentence to make the meaning clearer. Bulleted lists can be used in place of sentences that contain lists of three or more items.

>✕ We offer one complimentary hour of design support, so if you’re planning on making large, extensive changes to your theme, then you should consider hiring a Shopify Expert instead.<br>
✓ We offer one complimentary hour of design support. If you want to make big changes to your theme, then consider hiring a Shopify Expert instead.

Ensure that paragraphs are focused on one main idea. It is okay for paragraphs to be only a sentence or two if it keeps main ideas separate.

#### Use plain language

Use everyday words. Replace jargon and buzzwords with common English words.

#### Be friendly, but polite

Many cultures are more formal, especially in business transactions.

#### Use terms consistently

Some words that seem the same in English can translate very differently.

Always be conscious of the words you use to describe a UI element, action, or concept, and use that same term throughout.

>✕ The **newsletter signup form** is always displayed in the footer of your store. If you want to remove the **customer sign-up**, you can…<br>
✕ A **favicon** is a logo image that appears in the address bar. You can create a **favourites icon** by…<br>
✓ By default, this theme displays a **slideshow** on the home page. A **slideshow** is…

#### Use syntactic clues
Always use syntactic clues to make your sentences as clear and concise as possible. Note that this might require using passive voice.

>✕ You can change your tax settings using the admin.<br>
✓ You can change your tax settings by using the admin.<br>
✕ The theme settings window will display.

_Why is this wrong? Because the sentence seems unfinished. The translator might be prompted to ask “The theme settings window will display what?”_

>✓ The theme settings window will be **displayed**.

Another example of a syntactic clue is the use of the word “that”:

>✕ The way themes work hasn’t changed.<br>
✓ The way that themes work hasn’t changed.

#### Avoid words like may, while, or since
**May** is a difficult word to translate, because it can mean either **might** or **can**. Use **might** or **can** instead. Legal language can be an exception to this advice.

**While** can either mean **during** or **although**.

**Since** can either mean **because** or **from a certain date or time**, so it might not be clear in all contexts.

#### Avoid clumps of negative terms
Double and triple negatives can be difficult to understand, especially for non-native English readers. For example, change "Don't deselect the options that you want to keep." to "Ensure the options that you want to keep are selected."

#### Avoid humor
Humor doesn’t translate well. A joke tailored to North American or English-speaking audiences can be senseless or even offensive to global audiences.

#### Be inclusive of cultural differences
Avoid colloquial words, idioms, and pop culture references. Additionally, consider cultural norms when building a narrative within your docs:
* Be inclusive: Use customer names and locations from multiple countries and ethnicities.
* Product images should be acceptable to all cultures: Use product images that resonate positively with all international audiences. For example, avoid showing product images of bikinis, strapless dresses, T-shirts with slogans in English, or images of cartoon characters.

#### Use appropriate alt text
Ensure that you are accurately describing what is being shown by the image, because this is the way that screen readers will present the image to readers with a visual impairment. 

> ✕ An order<br>
✓ An example order for a T-shirt showing that the full amount is refunded

#### Avoid abbreviations and acronyms
Avoid abbreviations and acronyms. They often aren't the same in other languages, and they might not translate at all.

If you have to use an acronym, then spell it out on first use. Don’t use Latin abbreviations.

> ✕ You can add social media icons, such as Facebook, Pinterest, **et al**, to each product page.<br>
✕ Try using a search engine, **e.g.** Google, to find … <br>
✓ Try using a search engine, **such as** Google, to find…

#### Avoid shortcuts such as and/or and (s)
These are very difficult to translate, and non-native English readers might have difficulty understanding. Instead of **(s)**, try **each**, **every**, or **any of**.

> ✕ To translate your **theme(s)**, you can…<br>
✓ To translate **any of your themes**, you can…

Instead of **and/or**, use the more appropriate conjunction. Often, this ends up being **and**.

>✕ You can create products **and/or** variants in your admin…<br>
✓ You can create products **and** variants in your admin…

#### Use leading sentences for bulleted lists
Use a complete sentence when introducting a bulleted list. Sentence fragments can be confusing for translators and might prompt an inquiry from a translator asking if the sentence is incomplete. Leading sentences should clearly indicate that it's introducing a list. Further, clearly state what you are listing, don't end the sentence with "the following:".

>✕ You can:
* add a video section to your store’s theme
* use the rich text editor (RTE) to embed a video link
* add a video slideshow to your home page

>✕ If you want to add a video to your store:
* add a video section to your store’s theme
* use the rich text editor (RTE) to embed a video link
* add a video slideshow to your home page

>✕ To add a video to your store, do the following:
* add a video section to your store’s theme
* use the rich text editor (RTE) to embed a video link
* add a video slideshow to your home page

>✓ If you want to add a video to your store, then you can do any of the following steps:
* Add a video section to your store’s theme.
* Use the rich text editor (RTE) to embed a video link.
* Add a video slideshow to your home page.

>✓ Try any of the following methods to add a video to your store:
* Add a video section to your store’s theme.
* Use the rich text editor (RTE) to embed a video link.
* Add a video slideshow to your home page.

### Design

#### Adapt to expanding text
When translating from English, most languages need more space for the same information. While it is useful to write strings as short as possible, it’s also important to make sure components can expand or adapt to longer content.

For example: <br>

<table>

<tr>
<th>English</th>
<th>German</th>
</tr>
<tr>
		<td><img src="https://screenshot.click/06-15-mxxx0-a1lgk.jpg"></td>
		<td><img src="https://screenshot.click/06-13-v4uct-cso9k.jpg"></td>
	</tr>
		</table>
	<br>

How much space depends on the the language and the length of the original text, but this table from IBM's localization guidelines is a great start:

<table>

<tr>
<th>Original character count</th>
<th>Additional space needed</th>
</tr>
<tr>
		<td>Up to 10</td>
		<td>100% to 200%</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>11 to 20</td>
		<td>80% to 100%</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>21 to 30</td>
		<td>60% to 80%</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>31 to 50</td>
		<td>40% to 60%</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>51 to 70</td>
		<td>31% to 40%</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Over 70</td>
		<td>30%</td>
	</tr>

</table>

#### Avoid tables with narrow columns
Sometimes you need to use a table to present a complex set of information in an organized way. Words and phrases in other languages can take up more room than the English version, so if you use a table, keep the columns as wide as possible without looking empty or “off”. This helps lower the risk of other languages breaking the table layout when the content is translated. Many languages' translations are longer than English. For example, German can be up to 35% longer, and Japanese can be up to 55% longer.

Because tables are responsive, text-heavy tables should use no more than 2 columns. Tables that are not text-heavy can have 3 or more columns.

## Organization and structure

Shopify’s Help Center docs receive millions of pageviews per month. There are probably hundreds of people reading the docs [at this very moment](https://www.google.com/analytics/web/?hl=en#realtime/rt-overview/a82702w67835191p69823666/). Although all of these readers come to the docs for different reasons and in different settings, each one benefits from documentation that’s findable, usable, and relevant&mdash;or, in short, _organized_.

As writers, we have best practices to follow for many different content types and elements:

* [Topic types](#topic-types)
    * [Concept](#concept)
    * [Task](#task)
    * [Reference](#reference)
* [Writing task topics](#writing-task-topics)
* [Headings](#headings)
* [Links](#links)
* [FAQs](#faqs)

### Topic types

Most docs should be organized according to three different types of information, or "chunks": concept, task, and reference. By arranging our content along those lines, we make it easier for readers to scan a help doc so that they can find the specific information that they’re looking for. Any doc can contain content from these three categories, but try not to nest types or mix content chunks within a single paragraph.

#### Concept

A concept chunk answers the question “What is …?” It might include descriptions, overviews, broad outlines of processes (without specific steps), or generic steps. In practice, most docs begin with a concept chunk that introduces the topic, and sometimes answers the question “Why is this a thing?” This can encourage best practices at the storefront level, and help merchants learn why they might want to use a particular feature of Shopify.

A concept chunk might look like this:

> A product is an individual item for sale in a Shopify store. It can be a physical item, a digital download (such as a movie, music, or ebook file), or a service (equipment rental, work for hire, customization of another product, or an extended warranty).

Concept chunks should generally have titles that are only nouns or phrases that use -ing verbs, such as "Products", "Understanding products", or "Adding products".

#### Task

A task chunk answers the question: “How do I …?” It includes step-by-step instructions for specific tasks. Consider that task chunks might be read by users who are actively switching between the doc and another screen or window on their computer to complete a given task.

A task chunk might look like this:

>#### Steps:
>1. From your Shopify admin, go to [**Products**](https://admin.shopify.com/products).
>2. Click the product that you want to hide.
>3. In the **Visibility** section, deselect the channels that you want to hide the product from.
>4. Click **Save**.

Task chunks should generally have titles that use the imperative of a verb, which means no "-ing" or other verb endings. The title of the chunk should be a direct reference to what is achieved by following the steps within the chunk, such as "Add a product", "Add a product to a collection", or "Update the price of a product".

The "Steps:" heading in a task chunk must be an h4 heading (have four #s before it), regardless of the heading level before it.

If the first step in a set of instructions would take the merchant to the Shopify admin, then a link should be included to take the merchant directly to the relevant admin page (e.g. From your Shopify admin, go to [**Settings**](https://admin.shopify.com/settings).). If the instructions include a path within the admin (e.g. **Settings** > **Domains**), then add a link to the last step in the path (e.g. **Settings** > [**Domains**](https://admin.shopify.com/settings/domains)).

Refer to [*Writing task topics*](#writing-task-topics) for a full description of task-oriented writing.

#### Reference

A reference chunk answers the question "How does … work?" It offers a list of definitions or additional reference information. Reference chunks are designed for speed and detail, with the assumption that users want to read them and then move on quickly. If a reference chunk includes a list of properties or definitions, then in most cases it should be organized alphabetically.

A reference chunk might look like this:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th width="20%">Attribute</th>
        <th>Value</th>
        <th width="20%">Default</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>data-shop</code></td>
        <td>The myshopify domain (such as <code>storename.myshopify.com</code>) connected to the button.</td>
        <td>Your Shopify domain</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>data-product_handle</code></td>
        <td>The handle of the featured product, which is based on the product's title. Each of your products has a unique handle in Shopify.</td>
        <td>The featured product's handle</td>
    </tr>
</table>

### Writing task topics

Most of the docs are task-oriented: they're designed to guide the readers through the specific steps required to set up and run their stores. The best docs save a reader's time by helping them complete a task as quickly as possible. In particular, the specific ways that we document tasks, choices, and the results of user actions have a big impact on a doc's effectiveness.

* [Tasks](#tasks)
* [Choices](#choices)
* [Results of user actions](#results-of-user-actions)

#### Tasks

Start by providing introduction and context. In most cases, a doc shouldn’t begin by launching the reader into a set of instructions without offering any context first. Instead, it's a good idea to give some brief introductory comment or to define a key concept that's relevant to the topic. Try to anticipate what information would benefit the readers most as they begin to read the instructions. This is true also for major sub-sections within a doc (if you begin with a numbered step immediately after a heading, then consider whether or not some introduction or context at the outset might help the readers through the process).

Document the most simple and straightforward way to complete a task. When there's more than one way to complete a task, it can be confusing to a merchant if both methods are described. Instead, document the most simple way to achieve the task. If you want to include information about another method, then add a tip or note block that refers to it without documenting the whole process.

Tell the user what they can do with Shopify, not what Shopify can do. Structure the documentation around user actions rather than product features.

>✓ You can use email notifications to keep track of important updates and promotions.<br>
✕ This feature notifies you about key updates and promotions.

If there are conditions that would prevent a merchant from being able to perform an action or use a feature, then mention this early on in the document so that we don't waste a merchant's time. Considering creating a "considerations" or "requirements" section, or putting the information within a section's intro paragraphs.

Divide up the instructions in a way that anticipates how the readers might think of the task at hand. Try to separate the conceptual side from the mechanical: the readers think of what they’re doing as “adding products to the cart” rather than “clicking on the ‘add products’ button; entering the products’ names; clicking save.” This can help to conserve the readers’ attention, and makes it easier for them to switch between sub-tasks on a docs page and the Shopify admin.

Highlight optional steps in a task by beginning the step with "Optional:". Use your discretion when highlighting a step as optional: flagging consecutive steps as optional can be distracting, and it shouldn't be used for steps where there is a consequence for not performing the step. For example, providing an SEO description for each product is optional, but not providing this description hinders search engine hits.

In general, aim for short lists of numbered steps, which are more manageable for the reader than long lists. If you have a task that seems to require more than five or six steps, then consider whether it can be separated into separate sub tasks, either in a nested numbered list or in their own respective subheadings.

Make sure that the instructions for major tasks within a longer doc are effective standalone pieces of documentation. If the instructions for a task pick up abruptly where an earlier task left off, then the readers who begin at that point might struggle to orient themselves in the workflow. Start documenting each task at the beginning of the workflow required to complete it (the home page of the Shopify admin).

If the first step in a set of instructions would take the merchant to the Shopify admin, then a link should be included to take the merchant directly to the relevant admin page (e.g. From your Shopify admin, go to [**Settings**](https://admin.shopify.com/settings).). If the instructions include a path within the admin (e.g. **Settings** > **Domains**), then add a link to the last step in the path (e.g. **Settings** > [**Domains**](https://admin.shopify.com/settings/domains)).

To introduce a procedure, add `#### Steps:` before a numbered list. For example:

>You can print a test shipping label to make sure that your printer is set up properly. You won't be charged for printing a test label.
>
> #### Steps:
>1. From your Shopify admin, go to **Settings** > [**Shipping and delivery**](https://admin.shopify.com/shipping).
>2. In the **Shipping labels** section, click **Print test label**.

However, if there isn't anything between the preceding heading and the numbered list, then either add some useful content there or omit the `Steps:` heading.

In general, avoid grouping multiple actions together in a single numbered step. Each step should include only one or two user actions:

>x #### Steps:
>1. From your Shopify admin, go to **Products**, and then click **Add a product**
>2. Enter the product details, create any variants, and add any tags, then click **Save**.

>✓ #### Steps:
>1. From your Shopify admin, go to [**Products**](https://admin.shopify.com/products).
>2. Click **Add a product**, and then enter the product details.
>3. Click **Save**.

For navigation steps, simplify the instructions with the `>` symbol instead of repeating the word `click`. This shorthand makes the step more scannable. Don't bold the `>` symbol.

> 1. From your Shopify admin, go to **Products** > [**Collections**](https://admin.shopify.com/collections).

You can also use this shorthand for steps that involve a drop-down list:

>1. From your Shopify admin, go to [**Products**](https://admin.shopify.com/products).
>2. Click **More actions** > **Find more products to sell**.

For conditional cases, lead with “if” so the readers don’t have to read an entire sentence only to find out that the condition doesn't apply to them. Then include a "then" to help distinguish between the condition and the outcome:

>✓ If you need Z, then click A, B, and C.<br>
✕ Click A, B, and C, if you need Z.

Use command verbs consistently when you're directing the reader’s actions:
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Go with</th>
		<th>Avoid...</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>enter</td>
		<td>type in / input / write</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>click</td>
		<td>click on</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Click Themes</td>
		<td>click the Themes button</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>tap (touchscreen)</td>
		<td>click, select</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Because readers often glance back and forth between the doc and other screens, such as their Shopify admin, while they're reading, use visual and rhetorical signposts to make it easier for them keep track of their place in the doc. If an overall task requires many steps in multiple areas of the Shopify admin, then consider using meta steps, which break up an action into a few key generalized steps, and then nest the specific steps within these key general steps.

>##1. Add a product
>
>[steps to add a product]
>
>##2. Create a collection
>
>[steps to create a collection]
>
>##3. Add products to the collection
>
>[steps to add products to a collection]

Avoid using language that implies direction, such as “Click the button in the top right-hand corner.” Use the name of the button instead. Since the locations of buttons can change depending on the reader's device or the size of their screen, it's a good idea to avoid directional language.

Avoid telling the user to "find" or "locate" something in a task.
>✕ Find the **Pinterest** section, then click **Remove channel**.<br>
✓ In the **Pinterest** section, click **Remove channel**.

Use markdown rather than HTML for lists of numbered steps. This makes sure that the information is indented properly, which creates visible structure that helps the reader scan the information and discern the hierarchy of the doc.

In some cases you'll want to refer the reader to a demo or an example. We've set a standard phrase for this sort of thing:

>✓ To learn how this feature works, [visit the demo store](#).<br>
✕ Check out a demo of a [password protected store](#).

Link to the _Keyboard shortcuts_ page in the docs' Productivity section when asking the reader to copy and paste content (see `https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/productivity-tools/keyboard-shortcuts#basic-keyboard-shortcuts`). In most cases, you should do this only the first time that you refer to copying and pasting on that page of documentation.

>✓ First, [copy and paste](/manual/more/productivity/keyboard-shortcuts) the embed code.<br>
✕ First, copy+paste the embed code (`Ctrl+C`).

#### Choices

Use the verb "select" when you're telling the reader to pick something from a finite number of choices, such as from a list or drop-down menu. Use the verb "choose" when you're referring to the reader making a decision that's more open-ended, such as “You have to choose what kind of store you want to open”.

When writing steps for mobile, use the verb "tap" when a merchant needs to select something on their screen.

Use consistent phrasing when referring to the reader’s choice. Use the most direct “If you want to…” instead of more formal options such as “If you would like to…” or “if you wish to…”:

>✓ If you want to add a product, then click **Add product**.<br>
✕ If you wish to add a product, then click **Add product**.<br>
✕ If you’d like to add a product, then click **Add product**.

>✓ Select the item you want to add to the order.<br>
✕ Select the desired item.

If a set of instructions contains several “If you want to...” statements in a row, then consider using other means of representing those conditions or options. Long numbered lists that contain several optional or case-specific “steps” can mean the doc is actually a spec in disguise. Make sure to add "then" after the if statement's condition.

Be as direct as possible when representing forks or parallel approaches in the UI. Try to address potential states in the same instructions to avoid confusion:

>✓ Beside **Accept payment for this order**, use the the drop-down list or the available buttons to process payment.<br>
✕  Use the drop-down menu beside **Accept payment for this order** to process payment. Depending on your order, you might see a selection of buttons at this step instead.

#### Results of user actions

Don’t use a separate numbered step to describe only what is displayed by the UI or seen by the user as the result of an earlier action. If it's necessary to describe a specific result of a user action, then you can do so at the end of the step that describes the action to begin with. But in general, omit results statements unless the result is surprising or unexpected.

In most cases, don't include a separate “navigation statement” that indicates what the reader will see after they complete the step. Ideally, the documentation will be clear enough to keep the reader oriented:

>✓ 3. Tap **Take Payment**. You will be taken to the **Checkout** screen.<br>
✕ You'll see a confirmation message.

Avoid summary statements at the close of a task chunk:

>✓ 5. Click **Save** to complete the exchange and update your inventory.<br>
✕ 6. The purchase has effectively been exchanged and your inventory levels for each product have been properly updated.

Use references to the reader’s past actions to communicate necessity and progress, and to reinforce the intended order of operations. For progress within a series of steps, you can use a phrase such as “When you have …” or “After you…” (which imply necessity). For progress between tasks that are spread out across multiple sections, it's sometimes a good idea to begin a section with “Now that you have …” or “After you …”

For instructions, use the imperative verb form. Limit the use of the future tense to cases that actually refer to the chronological future:

>✓ Click **Save**. The price changes when the discount is applied.<br>
✕ Click **Save**. The price will change when the discount is applied.

>✓ Choose an End Date. After this date, the boosted post will revert to a regular post.<br>

When asking the reader to verify or confirm something, we default to the following phrasing:

- "make sure" in cases where there's still a related important task (instead of "check that" or "verify that")
- "confirm" for cases where they've already been told to do the thing, and we're reminding them

### Headings

Effective headings make it clear to the readers which sections of a doc are most relevant to their current tasks (making the content findable), and provide them with a good sense of their progression through the overall doc as they move from one task to the next (making the content usable).

For page-level or topic-level headings, use short, gerund statements (like “Creating products”) or short noun phrases (like "Themes for your online store"). Don't use imperatives. Make sure that each page title is unique, since duplicate titles are confusing when presented alongside each other in a list of search results. Consider also how much context the title will supply to the reader when it appears as a search result in the Help Center. Is the title clear enough for a reader to tell whether a page contains the information that they want?

For docs with longer titles, consider using a shorter variation in the `short_title` field of the doc’s YAML header. If you use a shorter title for the sidebar, then make sure that it clearly conveys the same topic or concept.

For section-level headings (H2, H3, and H4), use imperatives for tasks (like “Add a customer”), and either gerund statements or noun statements for broader, conceptual topics (like “Responding to in-app feedback” or “Domains overview”).

In general, the lower a heading is in the doc’s hierarchy, the more flexible you can be in terms of tone. These headings can be longer and more specific, or less formal.

Avoid pronouns in headings to keep them short. Go with “Connecting Facebook accounts” rather than “Connecting a Facebook account” or “Connecting your Facebook account”.

Avoid long strings of nouns in a heading. Go with “Posting products” or "Creating posts" rather than "Creating product posts" or “Creating product post pages”.

Try to maintain the heading hierarchy throughout the doc: don’t skip heading levels arbitrarily or abandon structure just because you're deep in the hierarchy. The heading hierarchy helps the readers to position themselves within the doc, whether they’re progressing through a specific workflow or quickly scanning through a doc to evaluate it. However, if the prescribed heading level doesn't work in a specific context or particular situation, then you can make judicious use of an alternative.

Keep the key terms close to the front of a heading to make it easier to scan quickly. Don’t preface them with “How to” or “To”.

  > ✓ Add a product<br>
  ✕ How to add a product

Where it makes sense to do so, maintain grammatical parallelism between headings of the same level. The heading "Next steps" is an exception, and can follow a series of otherwise grammatically parallel headings:

  >✓ Boost a post, Choose an audience, Fulfill an order<br>
  ✕ Boost a post, Choosing your audience, How to fulfill your orders

In most cases, headings should be statements rather than questions. Save question-style headings for the next steps, FAQs, or low-level headings that address specific functions.

Use sentence case for all headings, without periods at the end. References within headings to interface elements or buttons should be formatted and capitalized according to how they appear in the Shopify admin.

### Links

Links to other topics in the Help Center are a great way to send merchants to related information that helps them complete a task or learn about a concept. But too many links can make content harder to read, and following a link distracts the reader from the main point. Links without enough context can leave a reader wondering if they should go to wherever the link might take them. To make the most of our cross references, keep the following guidelines in mind.

Make sure that every inline link (a link within sentences and paragraphs) is clearly relevant and of value to the task or concept. Don't add links just because another concept is mentioned in passing. In general, it's a good idea to keep the number of inline links as low as possible.

Try to avoid adding links in steps of a task because they risk taking the reader out of the workflow that they're trying to accomplish.

If you need to include several links in a paragraph or section, then try to group them together so that the reader knows they are secondary but related information. This can prevent having a block of text that's peppered with distracting links.

Give preference to cross references at the end of sentences, paragraphs, or notes. Provide some introductory context to help the reader know whether visiting the link will be helpful to them.

### FAQs

You can create lists of frequently asked questions (FAQs) about a topic as a separate page or as a section on a page. FAQs should follow regular style guidance related to headings, punctuation, tone, and organizing content.

Before you add an FAQ, consider other options. For example, the content might fit into the documentation in a note block or subsection. Sometimes, we hear suggestions that an FAQ might help to answer questions, but you don't have to add an FAQ just because it's requested.

If you decide to add an FAQ, then use the following guidance:

* When a FAQ is added as a subsection of an article, add a list of questions with anchor links beneath the FAQ heading to help merchants scan the questions quickly.

* Separate long lists of questions into subtopics with appropriate headings.

* When possible, use real questions to match typical queries. Don't just duplicate the documentation.

* Start each response with a direct answer, such as `Yes.`, `No.`, `Sometimes.`, or `It depends.` Follow the direct answer with a second sentence that provides more information.

* Provide links to additional help or resources.


#### Documenting as teaching

**Provide next steps beyond the current doc** that link to relevant topics or tasks. These can be chosen deliberately to reflect multiple reader profiles and responses to the doc, including prospective users.

**Motivate the reader to learn** by explaining briefly in the introduction “why this [feature] is a thing” and making it clear what the merchant will gain from implementing it.

Where possible, **give the readers “early wins”** by making the first step or two of the task you’re describing relatively brief and manageable.

**Aim to integrate the current task with readers’ wider knowledge of the platform.** Connect the subject matter of the current doc with other aspects of the admin, the store-building process, and even the business-building process.

Although we avoid repetition and redundancy at the paragraph level, we can deliberately **include some redundancy at the document level to ensure the readers’ awareness of important points**. For example, a key warning or condition might be mentioned twice, once in the introductory comments and once in the task at the relevant step.

## Language and grammar

Use language and terms consistently across the docs. Check [Polaris](https://polaris.shopify.com/content/vocabulary) or the [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/) dictionary if you're not sure which form or spelling of a word to use.


### Abbreviations

**Try to avoid using abbreviations** such as ie. or eg. It is more friendly to use phrases such as "for example", and "such as" instead.

### Interface terminology

Try to avoid mentioning specific UI elements unless they need to be called out or aren't obvious. For example, don't write "Click the **Open** button." Instead, write "Click **Open**".

Beyond that:

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Go with</th>
		<th>Avoid...</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>rich text editor, the editor (<em>optional for second use</em>)</td>
		<td>Rich Text Editor, RTE</td>
	</tr>
        <tr>
              <td>menu</td>
	    <td>list</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<br>

Avoid referring to radio buttons. Just use the verb "select" and call it a day:

>✓ Select **Locations**.<br>
✕ Click the **Locations** radio button.<br>
✕ Select the **Locations** radio button.

When referring to checkboxes, use the verb "check" or "uncheck":

>✓ Check **Locations**.<br>
✓ Uncheck **Locations**.<br>
✕ Check the box beside **Locations**.<br>
✕ Click to check **Locations**.

When referring to toggle buttons, do this:

>✓ Activate **Locations** by tapping the toggle button.<br>
✕ Tap the **Locations** toggle to activate it.

There are a few ways to refer to "pop ups" -- let's use "dialog" for now:

>✓ In the **Edit shipping** dialog, click **Save**.<br>
✕ In the **Edit shipping** dialog window, click **Save**.<br>
✕ In the **Edit shipping** modal, click **Save**.

Avoid referring generally to what the reader can do in an "area" of Shopify. Instead, refer to specific actions and the pages in Shopify where the reader can perform them.

>✓ You can manage your orders on the **Orders** page in your Shopify admin. To manage draft orders, you need to go to the **Drafts** page instead.<br>
✕ You can manage your orders and draft orders in the **Orders** area in your Shopify admin.


### Numbers

**Write out numbers ten and under, except in cases where a numeral would be more natural**. In some cases, you can avoid using specific numbers where a more open-ended description would do:

>✓ You have the following choices: <br>
✕ You have these two choices:

### Plans

In general, **use the full term "the (x) plan when referring to Shopify's plans**. Try to avoid referring to merchants or features as (x) merchants or (x) features:

>✓ Bot protection is available only for stores on the Shopify Plus plan.<br>
✕ Bot protection is available only for merchants on the Shopify Plus plan.<br>
✕ Bot protection is a Shopify Plus feature.

### Pronouns

In general, **use the plural form of “customer” to avoid the grammatical issue of pronoun agreement**:

>✓ The customers can make their purchases through this gateway.<br>
✕ The customer can make their purchases through this gateway.<br>
✕ The customer can make his or her purchases through this gateway.

Where a singular form of “customer” is required, try to omit the personal pronoun reference.

>✓ Enter the customer’s credit card information, then click **Save**. <br>
✕ After the customer enters their credit card information, click **Save**.

**Use “you” when referring to the reader**. Do not use “we” to refer to yourself and the reader together:

>✓ After you enter the price, click **Save**.<br>
✕ We can add a customer to the order by clicking **Add Customer** at this step.

### Verbs

**For instructions, use the imperative / present tense form**. Limit the use of the future tense to cases that actually refer to the future:

>✓ Click the **Save** button. The price changes when the discount is applied.<br>
✕ Click the **Save** button. The price will change when the discount is applied.<br>
✓ Choose an end date. After this date, the boosted post will revert to a regular post.

**When FAQs have a yes or no answer, answer first with an initial fragment**, such as “Yes.” or “No.”

>✓ Yes. The price will change when the discount is applied.<br>
✕ Yes, the price will change when the discount is applied.

Be aware of procedural verbs that have similar -- but different! -- noun counterparts:

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Verb</th>
		<th>Noun</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>set up</td>
		<td>setup</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>log in</td>
		<td>login</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>check out</td>
		<td>checkout</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<br>

**Use the active voice** for the most part. Frame the doc in terms of “what the merchant does” instead of “what is being done by the merchant”:

>✓ You can add all your products to your store from the **Products** page of the admin.<br>
✕ Products are added to the store from the **Products** page of the admin.

**The passive voice can be used sometimes**. In a few cases it sounds way more natural than the active voice (with verbs like “publish” and nouns like “discount”):

>✓ The price changes when the discount is applied.<br>
✓ This updates all posts that have been published previously. <br>
✕ The price is changed when you click **Save**.

### Word list

Specific terms and how to use them.

#### Black Friday, Cyber Monday
Treating BFCM as a holiday is a marketing push by Shopify that merchants and their customers don't necessarily understand out of context. Treat Black Friday and Cyber Monday as separate, independent holidays and write out their names in full. You can refer to one without the other.

#### Shopify POS, POS, and point of sale

In most cases, write “Shopify POS”. However, in introductory material you might need to write out “point of sale (POS)” in some descriptions about in-person sales. Also, some Shopify admin elements might use different wording, so match the admin’s wording in those cases.

>✓ The Total sales amount includes online store sales and Shopify POS sales.<br>
✕ The sales amount includes online store sales and point of sale sales.

#### Shopify Support

When referencing Shopify's guru team, always refer to it as "Shopify Support".

#### zip code

Write this out in lowercase as two words.

---
## Punctuation and special characters

### Apostrophes

For possessives, use ``'s`` after singular nouns and proper nouns that end in the letter S. However, avoid using possessives frequently.

>✓ Edit your business's Facebook page.<br>
✕ Edit your business' Facebook page.<br>
✓ Edit the Facebook page for your business.

### Brackets

If you need to write a parenthetical comment, include it within ordinary sentence punctuation.

>✓ Use brackets sparingly (but use them well).<br>
✕ Use brackets sparingly (but use them well.)

Avoid putting complete sentences inside brackets.

>✓ Use brackets sparingly. They are tedious when overused.<br>
✕ Use brackets sparingly (they are tedious when overused).

Refer to different types of brackets consistently:

* `( )` = brackets<br>
* `[ ]` = square brackets<br>
* `{ }` = curly brackets<br>
* `< >` = angle brackets

### Colons

Use a colon at the end of a sentence or phrase that directly introduces a list, a set of instructions, or a code snippet.

Don't use a colon before an image or screenshot. Use a period instead, so that if an image is removed, no other editorial changes are required.

### Commas

Use the Oxford comma (before both *and* and *or*).

>✓ This screen displays your products, orders, and customers.<br>
✕ This screen displays your products, orders and customers.<br>

Use commas before conjunctions or linking adverbs where they help to emphasize sequence, timing, or cause and effect.

>✓ Select a variant, then click **Save**.<br>
✕ Select a variant and click **Save**.

Use commas after prepositional phrases except where it sounds weird. In general, very short prepositional phrases don’t require commas afterwards.

>✓ After you’ve finished editing your storefront, click **Save**.<br>
✓ In most cases the products will be set to visible.

Use commas to separate multiple adjectives when there’s no natural order.

>✓ We saw a strong, healthy unicorn.<br>
✕ We saw a strong healthy unicorn.

Don’t use commas after each item in a bulleted list.

### Currency

The ways that we show currencies and currency amounts depend on the context.

In general, assume that currency amounts are US dollars. Add a `$` symbol before the currency amount, and omit the decimal places for whole dollar amounts.

>✓ You can sign up for Shopify for as low as $9 per month.<br>
✓ Lintercorp charges a monthly fee of $9.99 to use their app.<br>
✕ Add the retail package to your Shopify plan for 40 dollars per month.<br>

When representing other currency amounts, use the [ISO 4027 standard currency code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) after the currency amount, separated by a space. Avoid using currency symbols, except where they're required to reduce ambiguity.

>✓ 400 EUR<br>
✕ 400 Euros<br>
✓ 25 GBP<br>
✕ £25 GBP<br>
✕ GBP 25

In cases where there's potential ambiguity between USD and other currencies, or in cases where USD is being compared with other currencies, add the USD currency code after the currency amount, and omit the initial `$` symbol.

>✓ If your business is based in Canada, then your invoice includes a charge of 25 USD. <br>

>✓ The following credits are available:
>* 25 USD
>* 20 CAD
>* 15 GBP
>* 20 EUR

### Exclamation marks

Don't use exclamation marks.

### Hyphens

Most compound adjectives (two words that combine to modify or describe another word) require hyphenation.

>✓ single-variant product<br>
✕ single variant product<br>

>✓ a unique single-variant product<br>
✕ a unique single variant product<br>

>✓ drop-down list<br>
✕ drop down menu

Examples of commonly used compound adjectives:

>✓ carrier-calculated shipping<br>
✓ third-party application<br>
✓ iOS-based app<br>
✓ iOS-compatible app<br>
✓ Shopify-supported theme

Omit a hyphen in compounds where it seems unusual.

>✓ a credit card terminal<br>
✕ a credit-card terminal<br>

>✓ a gift card policy<br>
✕ a gift-card policy

Avoid using only the hyphens when stacking up multiple parallel compounds. Expand each term to avoid potential confusion, even if it means some repetition.

>✓ Set up a vendor-specific or type-specific size chart.<br>
✕ Set up a vendor- or type-specific size chart.<br>

>✓ Set up specific size charts for vendors or types.<br>
✕ Set up a vendor or type specific size chart.

Don’t use a hyphen between adjectives and adverbs that end in `ly`.

>✓ this fully supported hardware<br>
✕ your newly-created product

Omit hyphens after most prefixes. Use one only if clarity requires it. If you've added a prefix that requires a hyphen, consider rewriting the phrase to avoid that prefix.

>✓ reorder<br>
✓ resend<br>
✓ recreate<br>
✕ re-send<br>
✕ un-do<br>

Don’t hyphenate `email` or `ecommerce`.

### Periods

Use periods:
* after the last item in an unordered list (but not after the other items in the same list)
* after list items that are complete sentences (and if one of the items in a list is a complete sentence, consider making them all complete sentences so that the list is fully parallel)
* outside of linked text (even when the link is at the end of a sentence).

Don't use periods:
* in headings
* in tables of contents or navigation lists
* at the end of each item in a list (unless one of the items is a complete sentence, in which case you should just add a period after each item in the list, and try to make them all complete sentences)
* inside formatting tags (like bold, code, or italics) unless it has a good reason to be there
* inside links.

### Quotation marks

Avoid using quotation marks unless they’re part of code.

>✓ Choose an audience from the **Audiences** section. <br>
✕ Choose an audience from the “Audiences” section.

### Semicolons

Don't use semicolons.

>✓ Click **Save** to continue. This will save the thing.<br>
✕ Click **Save** to continue; this will save the thing.

---
## Formatting

### Bold

**Use bold for**:
* the identifying names of user interface elements, such as pages, buttons, lists, menus, fields, and dialogs:

  >✓ On the **Products** page, browse through your products by swiping your screen left and right.

* anything the user clicks on or selects rather than typing:
  >✓ Click **Save**.<br>
  ✓ To view your Shopify admin, click **View your admin** on the **Admin options** dialog.

### Capitalization

**Use sentence case for the names of user interface elements**:

>✓ On the the **Products** page, click **Add product**.<br>
✕ On the products page, click **add product**.

**Match the capitalization of the user interface when referring to buttons**:

>✓ Tap **Refund**. (iPhone instructions)<br>
✓ Tap **REFUND**. (Android instructions)

**Use sentence case for all headings**:

>✓ Create a product variant<br>
✕ Create a Product Variant

**Don’t capitalize parts of Shopify that aren’t unique to Shopify**:

>✓ From your Shopify admin, you can publish blog posts about your retail store.<br>
✓ You can post the same products on Facebook and your online store.<br>
✕ From your Shopify Admin, you can publish Blog Posts about your Retail Store.

**Capitalize terms that are Shopify trademarks or branded feature names**, but not generic terms such as admin, app store, and dashboard:

>✓ Basic Shopify plan, Advanced Shopify plan<br>
✓ Shopify App Store<br>
✕ advanced Shopify plan<br>
✕ Shopify Admin

### Code

Use a `monospaced font` for small code fragments.

Use code formatting also for URLs, pathnames, filenames, and file extensions. File extensions should be set in lowercase and begin with a period, unless they are common abbreviations, such as CSV:

>✓ Delete `products.csv` from the `Exports` folder before creating a new CSV file. <br>
✕ Delete <kbd>products.csv</kbd> from *exports* before creating a new **CSV** file.<Br>
✓ Use your `myshopify.com` URL.

You can also use code formatting for buttons that show symbols instead of names:

>✓ To add a product, tap the `+` button.<br>
✕ To add a product, tap `+`.<br>
✕ To add a product, tap the plus button.

### Italics

**Use italics for**:
* Article titles when you refer to an article by its title within a sentence or link.
* Introducing special terminology.
* Adding emphasis in text where appropriate, and used sparingly). This is instead of using UPPERCASE FOR STRESS OR EMPHASIS, which you should never do.

### Key presses

- PC: Write `ctrl`, `shift`, `alt`, and `Windows key` for modifier keys.
- Mac: Write `command`, `option`, `control`, and `shift` for modifier keys.
- Write a + between the keys if the user needs to press both keys at the same time. Place a space between the key labels and the +. Do not use code formatting on the + sign.
- Capitalize single-letter keypresses like `G` and `H`, even when used in multi-key combos.
- Refer to platforms as PC and Mac, not Windows, macOS, or OS X.
- List PC key combos first, then Mac -- although we develop on Macs, most merchants are on PCs.

>✓ Press `ctrl` + `C` on a PC or `command` + `C` on a Mac to copy the code.
✓ From your Shopify admin, press `G` `H` to go to your store home page.

### Links

**Embed links around the shortest phrase necessary to make the link target obvious**. Avoid using a separate phrase just to call attention to the link:

>✓ You can [update your product descriptions] at any time.<br>
✕ [Click here] to learn more.<br>

>✓ These transactions aren’t covered in [Facebook’s ad policy].
✕ These transactions aren’t covered in Facebook’s ad policy. [Learn more &rsaquo;]<br>

**If a link appears at the end of a sentence, don't include the closing period within the link**.

**Set links to open in new tabs *only* in cases where the reader would benefit** from having the target link open beside the page you're linking from (whether it's the Shopify admin, a third-party admin, or a key reference).

**When referring to a named page in the Shopify admin, link only the name of the page**, and use bold formatting.

**When linking to a doc that describes how to do something, include a relevant verb in the link**:

>✓ You can &#91;delete the order&#93;(/manual/your-store/orders/cancel-order) afterwards.

### Lists

Use **unordered lists** for items whose order doesn’t matter. If the list items are not complete sentences, then start every line in lowercase (unless it requires caps for some other reason).

In cases where the bulleted list is an extended sentence which in another context would be separated by semicolons, use a period only at the end of the last item.

If any list item contains one or more sentences, use sentence case for every item and end each with a period.

If you have a bulleted list that is a series of terms, statuses, or elements followed by descriptions or explanations, bold the term and then separate it from the description with a hyphen. Example:

>**Complete** - Your tax information for this state is the same in both Shopify and Avalara.<br>
**Action required** - You have tax information for this state in Avalara that isn't included in your Shopify tax settings.

Use **numbered lists** for task-oriented steps. Use sentence case for each step. It’s not essential to introduce the list with a colon.

For **navigation lists and tables of content**, don't add punctuation.

### Notes

Notes are useful because they draw a reader’s attention to specific information. For that same reason, too many notes on a page can be distracting. They’re also often used to bring attention to negative information, so using them inappropriately can lead to a page of overstated warnings and limitations.

Currently, notes aren't read well by the Help Center Assistant chatbot, and so should be avoided in favor of adding the content directly into the section. If the note's content is purely tangential and it would not be detrimental to a reader if it was missed by the HCA, then you can still add that note. Caution blocks are still acceptable to use because those are necessary for us.

General note guidance:

* Use as few notes as possible, and never place two notes next to each other on a page. Wherever possible, include information in the main content of the page instead of using a note.
* Don’t add a note just because we’ve received a request to add a note. People outside our team might use the word “note”, but really all they want is some information added to a page.
* Try to limit notes to one or two sentences.
* Don’t place images in notes or place notes in tables.
* If you think you need to use more than a couple of sentences or to use an image in a note, then consider creating a section on the page for the content.
* If a page has a lot of notes, then try reorganizing the content of the page to create appropriate places for note content in the main text.
* Avoid putting notes within steps.

Use the following types of notes:

* [Note blocks](#note-blocks)
* [Caution blocks](#caution-blocks)
* [Tip blocks](#tip-blocks)
* [Growth blocks](#growth-blocks)
* [Plan requirement blocks](#plan-blocks)

#### Note blocks

Note blocks are used to add tangential information to a section. If the information is directly relevant to the current topic and true in every case, then it belongs in the main text.

Don't use a note block to highlight important information.

**Do**

>**Note**<br>
>Users with limited access can’t manage accounts other than their own.

**Don’t**

>**Note**<br>
>The Socket Mobile CHS Qi 2D barcode scanner is not compatible with Shopify POS for iPhone or Android.

This example is from the compatibility section of the 2D barcode scanner page. In this context, the content should be in the main text.

#### Caution blocks

Caution blocks are for content that we definitely want readers to notice and read. Use a caution block for information that aims to prevent merchants from seriously breaking something or losing money.

Don’t use a caution block just because something might not work.

**Do**

>**Caution**<br>
Do not select the External Credit or External Debit payment methods unless you're using an external card terminal and payment is being processed by a third-party payment gateway. Shopify doesn't process the payment when you use these payment methods.

**Don’t**

>**Caution**<br>
The gift receipt option will appear only if you have the receipt printer.

#### Tip blocks

Tip blocks tell the reader about a feature, tool, workflow, or concept that they can use to complete a task or understand something. Use a tip block for information that isn’t crucial to completing the task, and that can be safely ignored by the reader, but helps them learn.

Don’t use a tip block for content when a note or caution block would be more appropriate.

**Do**

>**Tip**<br>
You can restrict access to the register settings by enabling limited permissions in your staff settings.

**Don’t**

>**Tip**<br>
You won't see the options to print paper receipts if you don't have a receipt printer installed.

#### Growth blocks

Growth blocks are similar to tip blocks, but they emphasize business strategy. Growth blocks can be safely ignored by the reader. They should start with a question, and be followed by a sentence that links to the solution. Use a growth block to link to Help Center and external resources that help merchants sell in new ways and market their business.

Don’t use growth blocks to explain how a part of the Shopify product works. Don’t break the question-answer format.

Growth blocks use the phrase "Grow your business".

**Do**

>**Grow your business**<br>
Want to accept payments in person? Try the <a href="https://help.shopify.com/manual/sell-in-person/">Shopify POS app</a> on your iOS or Android device.

**Don’t**

>**Grow your business**<br>
You can control which collections display on Shopify POS by editing their visibility setting.


#### Plan requirement blocks

Plan requirement blocks are used to mention content that applies to specific Shopify plans only. For example, features available only to merchants on the Shopify Plus plan, or the POS Pro subscription.

### Tables

Use bold for table headings.
Don't provide titles or captions.
Avoid splitting and joining cells.

### Trademarks and intellectual property (IP)

Omit trademark and copyright symbols from product names, except in cases where that formatting is required based on a legal agreement with a third party.

Except for cases where it seems unreasonable, reproduce the formatting used in third parties’ product literature. For example, since Facebook capitalizes “News Feed” in their docs, we should reproduce that in our own.

### User input

Use a `monospaced font` for anything that the user physically types in, such as entries in fields and dialog boxes, tag names, commands, keyboard shortcuts, and file names.

>✓ In **Tax rate**, enter `15`.
